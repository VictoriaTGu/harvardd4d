        <h1>Term-Time Projects</h1>
        <p>D4Dâ€™s Term-Time Projects connects students who are interested in social impact and technology to innovative projects that seek to develop solutions to challenges from non-profit and other international development organizations. This connection benefits both sides: it gives students the initiative to get involved in international development and gain teamwork, coding, and problem solving experience; at the same time, it moves forward proposed solutions to global issues and helps non-profit organizations in human resource, infrastructure improvement, and presence building at Harvard. Students also have the option to create their own project and lead it to completion. By providing a bridge for students and impact projects, Term-Time Project addresses the lack of non-profit opportunities for CS students on campus, raises awareness for international development challenges, and encourages students to contribute to the effort of solving these challenges.</p>
